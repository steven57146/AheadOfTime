Pavlov's Watchface
==================

Pavlov's Watchface was developed for the 2-day Google Wearable Hackathon in Boston, MA in 
January of 2015. This watchface allows the user to train themselves to be on time by always
being fast, but never by the same amount. The time offset follows a normal distribution 
around a user-defined number of minutes and adjusts itself as the user is late or on time.
By tracking when the user has arrived at their destination, the application is able to ask
the user if they were late or on time. If late, the mean of the distribution will be moved
forward, training the user to be on time. If the user is consistently on time, they will be
rewarded by getting closer and closer to the true time.
